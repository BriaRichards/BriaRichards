### Hi there, Welcome to my page!ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently completing a data science bootcamp where I have gained proficiency in Python, which has become my go-to programming language for data manipulation, analysis, and visualisation.
- I have been introduced to the fundamentals of machine learning, including supervised learning algorithms. I have explored techniques such as linear regression, which has given me a solid understanding of how to model and predict continuous outcomes based on given features.
